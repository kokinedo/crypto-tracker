# ReactJS - Crypto-Finance-Tracker üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª

```sh 
Current project status: Completed. ‚úÖ  
```

This is an exercise react application to display and search on Cryptocurrency with an API:
  - Axios
  - CoinGecko API
  - Hooks

# ~ Code Example: üë®üèø‚Äçüíª 

As an example of the project, Axios JS (a popular, promise-based HTTP client that sports an easy-to-use API and can be used in both the browser and Node) was used to retrieve data from the CoinGecko API and filter through it:

```sh
function App() {
  const [coins, setCoins] = useState([]);
  const [search, setSearch] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/coins/markets?vs_currency=usd&order=market_cap_desc&per_page=100&page=1&sparkline=false'
    )
      .then(res => {
        setCoins(res.data);
      })
      .catch(error => console.log(error));
  }, []);

  const handleChange = e => {
    setSearch(e.target.value)
  }

  const filteredCoins = coins.filter(coin =>
    coin.name.toLowerCase().includes(search.toLowerCase())
  )
```

After mapping this data to the `coins` state array and passing it as props to the Coin component, a limited amount of coins is rendered dynamically to the main Board component.
